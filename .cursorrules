# Project Rules: CompasScan

Act as a Senior Vibe-Coder (Python/Serverless/AI Expert). This project is an automated competitive intelligence tool.

## 1. Tech Stack & Infrastructure
- **Language:** Python 3.9+ (Strict typing where possible).
- **Package Managers:**
  - Backend (Python): Use **`uv`** exclusively (`uv pip install ...`). **Never** use pip directly.
  - Frontend (JS/TS): Use **`bun`** exclusively (`bun install`, `bun run dev`).
- **Deployment:** Vercel Serverless Functions (`api/index.py` is the entrypoint).
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL). Always use `api/db.py` for connections.
- **Artificial Intelligence (Brain):** Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (via `google-generativeai`). It is the primary source of analysis.
- **Search (Fallback):** Google Custom Search JSON API (via `requests`). ❌ SCRAPING LIBRARIES like `googlesearch-python` ARE FORBIDDEN.

## 2. Gitflow & Version Control

### 2.1 Process Rules
- **Workflow:** Strict Gitflow with 3-tier deployment.
- **Branch Structure:**
  - `main` - Production (https://compas-scan.vercel.app)
  - `staging` - Pre-production/QA (https://compas-scan-staging.vercel.app)
  - `develop` - Development (https://compas-scan-dev.vercel.app)
  - `feature/*`, `refactor/*`, `fix/*`, `docs/*` - Working branches
- **Integration Flow:**
  - ❌ DIRECT MERGE to `develop`, `staging`, or `main` locally is FORBIDDEN.
  - ✅ ALWAYS create a Pull Request (PR) from working branch.
  - ✅ Flow: `feature/*` → `develop` → `staging` → `main`
  - ✅ **ALL promotions require PRs:**
    - `feature/*` → `develop` (via PR)
    - `develop` → `staging` (via PR)
    - `staging` → `main` (via PR)
  - ✅ Merge is done exclusively via PR (GitHub UI or `gh pr merge` CLI).
- **Promotion Strategy:**
  - `develop`: Continuous integration (auto-deploy on merge)
  - `staging`: Weekly releases for QA testing
  - `main`: Production releases (after staging approval)
- **Commits:** In English and Conventional Commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`).

### 2.2 GitHub MCP Tool Usage (If Configured)
**Purpose:** GitHub MCP automates PR creation and provides repository context, while following the Gitflow process defined above.

- ✅ **Official GitHub MCP Server:** https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server (Go-based, actively maintained)
- ✅ **Allowed operations:**
  - Create pull requests (automates Step 7 of Agent Protocol)
  - Query repository information (PRs, issues, branches, commits)
  - Create issues
- ❌ **Prohibited operations:**
  - Merge pull requests (must use `gh pr merge` CLI - see Agent Protocol Step 8)
  - Close PRs without proper merge workflow
- ✅ **Recommended:** Use `--read-only` mode for query operations

## 3. Architecture & Modularity
- `api/index.py`: Entrypoint.
- `api/compas_core.py`: Main orchestrator. Decides whether to use AI or traditional search.
- `api/gemini_service.py`: Encapsulated module for all AI interactions.
- `api/constants.py`: ALL static lists (`STOP_WORDS`, `FAMOUS_DOMAINS`, `HEADERS`) must live here.
- `tests/test_local.py`: Main test script. Must support CLI arguments and generate `results.json` locally (ignored by git).

## 4. Business Logic (The "Brain")
The goal is to classify competitors into two types using a Hybrid approach (AI > Web):

**Strategy 1: Direct Consultant (Gemini) 🌟**
- High Priority. AI is consulted to identify direct competitors and classify them.

**Strategy 2: Signal-Based Search (Fallback) 🔍**
- If AI fails, enhanced web search is activated.
- **HDA (High Domain Availability):** Global competitors. Factors: Domain in `FAMOUS_DOMAINS`, strong keyword match.
- **LDA (Low Domain Availability):** Niche competitors. Factors: Semantic match in snippet.

**Noise Filters:**
- Always exclude: News sites, Forums (Reddit, Quora), Subdomains of the brand itself.

## 5. Vibe-Coder Best Practices
- **Transparency:** The JSON report must include a `justification` or `Discarded_Candidates` section.
- **Clean Code:** No dead code or debug prints in production.
- **Config:** Secrets always in `os.environ.get()`.
- **Documentation:** ALWAYS update `README.md` when adding new features or changing architecture.

## 5.1 Documentation Language Rules (MANDATORY) 📝
- **Multi-language READMEs:** When modifying `README.md` or `docs/README.md`, you MUST update ALL language versions:
  - `README.md` (English) ↔ `README.es.md` (Spanish)
  - `docs/README.md` (English) ↔ `docs/README.es.md` (Spanish)
- **All `/docs` content:** All documentation files in the `/docs` directory and subdirectories MUST be written in **English only**.
  - Exception: Only `docs/README.md` and `docs/README.es.md` are multi-language.
  - All other docs (DOCKER.md, API_KEYS_GUIDE.md, CACHING.md, etc.) are English-only.
- **Language selector:** Both `docs/README.md` and `docs/README.es.md` must include a language selector at the top linking to each other.

## 6. Agent Protocol (MANDATORY) 🛡️
Before writing code or applying fixes, you MUST follow this sequence:

1.  **Check Branch:** Verify current branch. If on `main`, `staging`, or `develop`, STOP and create a new branch.
2.  **Create Branch:** For any change, generate a command to create a specific branch:
    - New Feature -> `feature/name`
    - Bug Fix -> `fix/name`
    - Refactor -> `refactor/name`
3.  **Apply Changes:** Write the code only after the branch is active.
4.  **Test:** Run `uv run python tests/test_local.py "Brand"` to verify.
5.  **📝 UPDATE ROADMAP:** If completing a Roadmap item, update `.cursorrules` to mark it as `[Done]` and move `(Current)` to the next item BEFORE committing.
6.  **Commit & Push:** Generate standard git commands (include .cursorrules if roadmap was updated).
7.  **Create PR:** 
    - For working branches → `develop`: `gh pr create --base develop ...`
    - For `develop` → `staging`: `gh pr create --base staging ...`
    - For `staging` → `main`: `gh pr create --base main ...`
8.  **✋ STOP & ASK:** Do NOT merge automatically. Ask the user: *"PR created. Ready to merge?"*. Only proceed if confirmed.
