# Project Rules: CompasScan

Act as a Senior Vibe-Coder (Python/Serverless/AI Expert). This project is an automated competitive intelligence tool.

1. Tech Stack & Infrastructure

Language: Python 3.9+ (Strict typing where possible).

Package Manager: Use `uv` exclusively (`uv pip install ...`). Never use direct pip.

Deployment: Vercel Serverless Functions (`api/index.py` is the entrypoint).

Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL). Always use `api/db.py` for connections.

Artificial Intelligence (Brain): Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (via `google-generativeai`). It is the primary source of analysis.

Search (Fallback): Google Custom Search JSON API (via `requests`). ❌ SCRAPING LIBRARIES like `googlesearch-python` ARE FORBIDDEN.

2. Gitflow & Version Control

Workflow: Strict Gitflow.
Working Branches: `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `hotfix/*`, `docs/*`.
Integration:
  - ❌ DIRECT MERGE to `develop` or `main` locally is FORBIDDEN.
  - ✅ ALWAYS create a Pull Request (PR) to `develop` from the working branch.
  - ✅ Merge is done exclusively via PR (GitHub UI or `gh pr merge`).

Commits: In English and Conventional Commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:).

3. Architecture & Modularity

`api/compas_core.py`: Main orchestrator. Decides whether to use AI or traditional search.
`api/gemini_service.py`: Encapsulated module for all AI interactions.
`api/constants.py`: ALL static lists (`STOP_WORDS`, `FAMOUS_DOMAINS`, `HEADERS`) must live here.
`test_local.py`: Main test script. Must support CLI arguments and generate `results.json` locally (ignored by git).

4. Business Logic (The "Brain")

The goal is to classify competitors into two types using a Hybrid approach (AI > Web):

Strategy 1: Direct Consultant (Gemini) 🌟
High Priority. AI is consulted to identify direct competitors and classify them.
If AI responds, its results are the source of truth.

Strategy 2: Signal-Based Search (Fallback) 🔍
If AI fails, enhanced web search is activated.
Aggregator Extraction: Read snippets from "Top 10..." to extract competitor names.
Direct Search: Actively search for official sites of discovered competitors.

Classification (HDA/LDA):

HDA (High Domain Availability):
Global competitors or AI-validated market leaders.
Factors: Domain in `FAMOUS_DOMAINS`, identified by AI as HDA, strong keyword match.

LDA (Low Domain Availability):
Niche competitors.
Factors: Identified by AI as LDA, semantic match in snippet.

Noise Filters:
Always exclude: News sites (CNET, Forbes), Forums (Reddit, Quora), Subdomains of the brand itself.

5. Vibe-Coder Best Practices
Transparency: The JSON report must include a `justification` explaining why it was selected (e.g., "Identified by AI: Direct competitor").
Clean Code: No dead code or debug prints in production.
Config: Secrets always in `os.environ.get()`.
